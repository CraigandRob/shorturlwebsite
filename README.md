For the website and shortlinks

This is a simple website that uses Jekyll to generate static pages. It is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is a simple one-page site with a few links to other pages

The static pages is in the _pages directory.

The shortlinks are in the root directory. They are markdown files that have a layout of redirected. The redirect_to is the URL that the shortlink will redirect to. The permalink is the shortlink.

the anewone.ps1 script will create a new shortlink file with the name of the shortlink

the whatdowehave.md page shows all the shortlinks that are available for when we forget :-)
